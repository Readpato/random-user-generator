## Description

An application that brings forth random users.

Try it here: <a href="https://readpato.github.io/random-user-generator/">Demo</a>

### Technologies Used

For this project the technologies and tools used were:

- Vue
- SASS
- NPM
- Cypress

#

## Installation

As this project runs with Vue and Cypress you will have to have NPM or anything similar and then run this little code snippet on the CLI.

```
npm install
```

This will allow to download the dependencies you need to run the Random User Generator properly.

#

## Utilization

The Random User Generator isn't complicated. The web page will load and a random person will be already loaded.

If the user desires to get a new random person, they just have to click the button "Get Random User" and it will be automatically generated.

## Challenges Faced

- Using Vue.js for the first time!

#

## What I learned

- Being the first time using a major framework, I learned that documentation is really important. If it's good redacted, it will help the consumer to understand concepts way faster.

- Creation of Vue components named Single File Components (SFC) that encapsulates JavaScript(the logic), HTML(the template) and CSS(the style).

- How to create an app instance, text interpolation (using the Mustache syntax), directive bindings as v-bind, v-on and their respective users.

- How to use the Vue Developer Tools and Vue CLI.

- Installing SASS as a global module to be of use for all the components of the application.
